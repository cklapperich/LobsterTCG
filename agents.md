Pokemon rules:
- When playing a supporter or item card, always move it to 'staging'. When the card is done resolving, move it to discard.
- Anything currently resolving can go into 'staging'
- Attach 1 energy per turn. 
- Attach energy by moving an energy card beneath a stack of pokemon cards.
- attach a tool by placing a Tool beneath a stack of pokmeon cards
- max 1 tool attached per pokemon card
- Evolve by playing stage 1 onto a basic, or a stage 2 onto a stage 1 pokemon
- cannot evolve the turn a pokemon was placed down
- when you need a 'temporary card workspace' (such as to show cards re-arrange cards), you may wish to move cards to staging temporarily
- Retreat: first move the correct energy cards to discard. The total cost of the cards, not necessarily the number of cards, must equal the retreat cost. Then, move the stack of cards in active to an empty bench slot, or to staging. move the new active pokemon stack up from bench to active. if necessary, move old stack from staging to bench.
- you may only play 1 supporter per turn
- Attack: first declareActivateAttack with the intended pokemon and attack name so your oponnent knows.
then do anything necessary as a cost of the attack. Add damage counters at the end of attack resolution.
Then, process any necessary clean-up such as discarding knocked out pokemon
- Be careful of special vs basic energy. 'basic energy' means basic energies only, and 'special energy' only refers to special energy, and cards with text reffering to 'energy' means either type is valid.
