Pokemon rules:

Unless an effect states otherwise:
- you may only play 1 supporter per turn
- you may only play 1 energy per turn
- Evolve by playing stage 1 onto a basic, or a stage 2 onto a stage 1 pokemon
- Be careful of special vs basic energy. 'basic energy' means basic energies only, and 'special energy' only refers to special energy, and cards with text reffering to 'energy' means either type is valid.
- Retreating requires you to discard energy with value equal to the retreat cost
- max 1 tool attached per pokemon
- when you KO an opossing pokemon, take 1 prize card
- when you have no prize cards left to take, you may declare victory
- if there is truly no hope of victory, you may offer to concede
- A pokemon with more damage than its HP becomes knocked out. This pokemon and all cards attached are sent to its owners discard zone.
- Only one stadium may be in play. If a stadium is already in play, discard that stadium, then the new stadium moves in. This lets you discard your own or enemy stadium cards.
- At start of game: you must place a basic pokemon onto the active slot
- if you opening hand has 0 basic pokemon, you must mulligan. Put all cards to deck. shuffle deck. Draw 7. Oponnent may choose to draw 1 on their next turn for each mulligan you take. Repeat this process until you draw a Basic pokemon
- on your first turn: you DO draw a card, giving you 8 cards to start with
- you may not play a supporter on your first turn
- you may not declare an attack on your first turn
- some attacks require you to flip coins, do so with the coin flip tool, then manually add up the heads/tails and add counters or move cards according to the effect

How to execute actions:
- When playing a supporter or item card, always move it to 'staging'. When the card is done resolving, move it to discard.
- Anything currently resolving can go into 'staging'
- Attach energy by moving an energy card beneath a stack of pokemon cards.
- attach a tool by placing a Tool beneath a stack of pokmeon cards
- cannot evolve the turn a pokemon was placed down
- when you need a 'temporary card workspace' (such as to show cards re-arrange cards), you may wish to move cards to staging temporarily
- Retreat: first move the correct energy cards to discard. Then, move the stack of cards in active to an empty bench slot, or to staging. move the new active pokemon stack up from bench to active. if necessary, move old stack from staging to bench.
- Attack: first declareActivateAttack with the intended pokemon and attack name so your oponnent knows.
then do anything necessary as a cost of the attack. Add damage counters at the end of attack resolution.
Then, process any necessary clean-up such as discarding knocked out pokemon
- If you place damage counters: you are responsible for moving oponnents pokemon to their oponnents discard pile.
- Draw card: move from deck to hand
- take prize card: move from prize zone to hand
- it can be useful to memorize whats in your prize cards, or to not a card missing from your deck when you execute a search. 

TASK: 
Create a step-by-step plan for an agent to follow by moving cards around.

TASK:
Create a high level plan of what to play where

TASK:
Implement the plan by moving the cards to the appropriate locations. If you are incapable of executing the next step of the plan (ie a bad coin flip, or card not found when searching deck): your task is complete, simply return.
