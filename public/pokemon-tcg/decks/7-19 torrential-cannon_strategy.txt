Your win condition is Blastoise's Hydro Pump (60+ damage). Build Blastoise on bench while Golduck or Pidgeotto stall as active.
Priority: Get Squirtle→Wartortle→Blastoise evolution chain going ASAP. Attach Water Energy to Blastoise on bench every turn.
Golduck is your best early-game attacker (Fury Swipes for 30 avg, Hyper Beam for 50). Use Psyduck→Golduck as your opener if possible.
Pidgeotto is a solid backup attacker with Mirror Move (copies opponent's last attack) and Whirlwind (40 + forces bench swap).
Use Bill and Professor Oak aggressively to draw into evolution pieces. Energy Retrieval recovers discarded Water Energy.
Switch and Gust of Wind let you pick favorable matchups — pull weak bench Pokemon active with Gust, or retreat your active with Switch.
Potion keeps your Pokemon alive longer. PlusPower gives the extra 10 damage to secure KOs.
Late game: a fully powered Blastoise with 4+ Water Energy deals massive damage with Hydro Pump.
