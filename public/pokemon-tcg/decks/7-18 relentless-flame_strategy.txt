Your win condition is Charizard's Fire Spin (100 damage, discard 2 Energy). Build Charizard on bench while Nidorino or Arcanine fights.
Priority: Get Charmander→Charmeleon→Charizard chain going. Attach Fire Energy to Charizard on bench every turn.
Nidorino is your best early attacker — Double Kick averages 60 damage for just 3 Colorless. Open with Nidoran♂ if possible.
Arcanine is a solid mid-game threat with Flamethrower (50 + discard 1 Fire Energy). Use as bridge while building Charizard.
Charmeleon can fight in a pinch with Slash (30) or Flamethrower (50), but save it for evolution if possible.
Use Bill and Professor Oak to draw into evolution pieces fast. Energy Retrieval is critical — recovers Fire Energy discarded by Fire Spin and Flamethrower.
Switch lets you retreat a damaged active to protect it. Gust of Wind pulls weak bench Pokemon active for easy prizes.
PlusPower gives +10 damage to secure KOs. Potion keeps attackers alive.
Late game: Charizard's Energy Burn converts all Energy to Fire, so any Energy works. Fire Spin 100 damage KOs almost anything.
