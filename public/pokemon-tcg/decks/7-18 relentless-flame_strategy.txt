Your win condition is Charizard, try and build it up as an attacker and keep it safe till its ready.
Rapidash is a very strong attacker and staller, and easier to build up, sometimes wins you the game on its own, but not as game-winning as charizard.
nidoran rarely useful except for call for family sadly, you wont often build it up into nidoqueen until very late game or no better options.
Farfetch'd for 'collect' and no other purpose to it. Use charizard poke-power every turn and just retreat it then use pokepower from its bench if oponnent is about to kill it.
