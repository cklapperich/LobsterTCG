Your goal is to get a dreepy on your bench, evolve to Dragapult.. power it up, then switch it in and attack with it. Try to attack your oponnents strong pokemon first: let them knock one of your pokemon out, or boss's orders their strong pokemon out to the front. 
Tatsugiri cant attack, no water energy, you have to reatreat/switch it out or use its ability its only here for the ability.
Natu is only for evolving to xatu.
xatu is only for using its ability.
When using Dragapults attack, try to knock out weak benched pokemon as quickly as possible, be agressive and take prizes.
