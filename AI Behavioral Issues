logging.ts:11 [thinking] Now I can see the game state. I evolved Spoink into Grumpig and used Energized Steps, peeking at the top 4 cards of my deck. I need to see what energy cards were in those top 4 cards to attach them. Let me search my deck to see what cards are there and identify any Basic Energy cards that were in the top 4.

Looking at my hand, I have 3 Basic Psychic Energy cards. I should attach one to power up my attackers.

My plan:
1. First, let me search my deck to see what the top 4 cards were (to complete the Energized Steps ability)
2. Attach any Basic Energy found to my Pokemon
3. Attach a Psychic Energy from hand to one of my Pokemon
4. Attack Haunter with Mimikyu's Scratch (20 damage) - this will KO Haunter since it already has 20 damage and only has 80 HP remaining

Wait, looking at the combat notes, Haunter has 100 HP and 20 damage, so it has 80 HP remaining. Mimikyu's Scratch does 20 damage, which won't KO it. But I should still attack to apply more damage.

Actually, let me reconsider. I have 3 Psychic Energy in hand. I could:
- Attach energy to Mega Diancie ex to power up Garland Ray
- Or attach to Grumpig to use Psychic Sphere

But for now, let me complete the Energized Steps ability by searching my deck to see what energy cards were available, then attach energy and attack.
