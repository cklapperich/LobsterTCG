logging.ts:11 [thinking] Let me analyze the current game state:

**My Board:**
- Active: Farfetch'd with 60/80 HP (has 20 damage), attached Fire Energy
- Bench 1: Nidoran♀
- Hand: Copycat, Fire Energy x3, Farfetch'd, Charmander
- Deck: 45 cards

**Opponent's Board:**
- Active: Golduck with 2 Water Energy attached
- Bench 1: Pidgey
- Bench 2: Farfetch'd
- Hand: 5 cards

**Key Information:**
- Golduck used Amnesia last turn, blocking my Farfetch'd's "Collect" attack
- My Farfetch'd has 20 damage (60/80 HP remaining)
- I have 6 cards in hand
- Opponent has 5 cards in hand

**My Options:**
1. Attach Fire Energy to Farfetch'd (can use Tool Buster next turn if needed)
2. Play Copycat to draw 5 cards (matching opponent's hand size)
3. Play Farfetch'd or Charmander to bench
4. Attack with Farfetch'd's Tool Buster (20 damage, or 90 if they have a tool)

Since Golduck used Amnesia on "Collect", I can still use "Tool Buster" which costs [Colorless] and I have Fire Energy attached. Tool Buster does 20 damage, or 90 if I discard a tool from the opponent's Active Pokemon. Golduck doesn't have a tool attached, so it would only do 20 damage.

Actually, looking at the energy cost - Tool Buster costs [Colorless] which means any energy type works. I have Fire Energy attached, so I can use Tool Buster for 20 damage.

But wait - I should think about my strategy. I have Copycat in hand which lets me shuffle my hand and draw cards equal to opponent's hand (5 cards). That could be good for finding more resources.

I also have 3 Fire Energy in hand. I could:
1. Attach one to Farfetch'd (building up for future attacks)


2. Play Copycat to refresh my hand
3. Bench Charmander (potential future attacker)

I'll prioritize building my board and hand. Copycat offers a strategic advantage by potentially drawing 5 new cards, which could reveal more powerful options. Attaching Fire Energy to Farfetch'd strengthens my current active Pokemon, while benching Charmander provides a backup attacker. This approach maximizes my turn's potential and sets up future strategic moves.
logging.ts:14 [AI] Let me analyze the current situation:

**Current State:**
- My Active Farfetch'd has 20 damage (60/80 HP)
- Golduck used Amnesia last turn, blocking my "Collect" attack
- I have 6 cards in hand, opponent has 5
- I have 3 Fire Energy in hand and a Charmander I could bench

**Strategy:**
Since Collect is blocked by Amnesia, I should use Tool Buster this turn (20 damage). But first, let me build up my board - I'll attach energy, play Copycat to draw 5 fresh cards, and bench Charmander for future evolution potential.
